## Introduction 

This dataset shows the result of the 2023 election held Nigeria in Feb 23rd 2023 by the Nigeria Inec, It's a total of 20 columns and 471 records. It's consist of the result of the parties including the pu_unit_code and addresses. 7 more columns were added, Addresses, latitude, Longitude, APC Outliers, PDP outliers, LP outliers and NNPP outliers.

## Purpose of Analyses
1. To determine the irregularities in the election.
2. To discovered the most irregular locations in the state

## Methodology

Since the dataset only have addresses and not the latitude nor longitude. I have to get the geographical location of all the polling unit! So this was done by using python API Geopy.
So at first I imported my data and generated the latitude and longitude of the each location with this code.
![Code to generate lat and long](https://github.com/Danboko19/Hng11-stage-1-data-analyst-task-report-/assets/148493509/01449e83-acb8-449a-8d32-bcdffe070e31)

### And I've this result

Then I generated outliers and then determine the close poling unit with one another with a proximity radius of 5km.
The following code were used in other to achieved this:

## Result of the analysis

After determining the polling unit close to one another. I used my generated result to the determine the top three outliers which are the top irregularities in the entire state. 
Which are as shown in the illustration below;

This was generated by using the following code;

## Conclusions

2023 election in calabar was a fair and free election with less irregularities but some location didn't go well, which not possible to not witness such a things.
